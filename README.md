# Arduino LED Flash

Components Required:
Arduino Mega 1 red LED, 1 yellow LED
USB cable 2 x 330 ohm resistors
Breadboard jumper wires as required

Wire up the two LED’s to any two digital pins. Create a program based on the example in class
that will ask for the colour of LED to flash (use a single letter like ‘r’ for red and ‘y’ for yellow)
and the number of times to flash.
